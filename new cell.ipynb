This led to the creation of `processed_resume_skills` and `processed_required_skills` columns.\n","*   **Textual Data Vectorized with TF-IDF**: Skills were preprocessed (e.g., \"data science\" became \"data\\_science\") and vectorized using `TfidfVectorizer`. This generated TF-IDF vectors for all 650 resumes and 1650 job descriptions, each represented by 55 features.\n","*   **Job Matching Algorithm Implemented**:\n","    *   Cosine similarity was calculated between candidate and job skill vectors, resulting in a `(650, 1650)` match percentage matrix.\n","    *   Functions `recommend_top_jobs` and `recommend_top_candidates` were developed to rank job opportunities for candidates and vice-versa, successfully demonstrated with sample outputs (e.g., `CAND_1000` received a 53.70% match with `JOB_2026`).\n","*   **Skill Gap Analysis Module Developed**: The `analyze_skill_gap` function was created to identify `matched_skills`, `missing_skills`, and `extra_skills` between a candidate and a job using set-based comparisons. For `CAND_1000` and `JOB_1000`, skills like `{'ethiopian tax law'}` were matched, while others like `{'data structures', 'nosql'}` were missing.\n","*   **Recommendation Module Enhanced**: The `generate_recommendations` function was refined to provide structured suggestions for `skills_to_learn`, `training_resources` (including platform, resource name, and dummy URL), and `related_job_roles` based on skill gap analysis for a given candidate and job.\n","\n","### Insights or Next Steps\n","\n","*   The current skill extraction relies on exact keyword matching; integrating more advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like word embeddings or named entity recognition could improve the identification of implicit or semantically similar skills, leading to more nuanced matches.\n","*   The recommendation module is largely rule-based; leveraging machine learning models (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering) could further personalize and enhance job and skill recommendations based on user interaction data and broader patterns.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"a3291c41"},"source":["# Task\n","## Database Initialization and Population\n","\n","### Subtask:\n","Initialize a SQLite database named `job_recommendation_system.db` in the Colab environment.

Additionally, the TF-IDF vectorization currently relies on a globally accessible `skill_dictionary` and DataFrames; this dependency should be re-evaluated for robustness, potentially by embedding the skill dictionary directly into the `TfidfVectorizer`'s vocabulary or managing it more explicitly across the application lifecycle.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"2b77f86e"},"source":["# Task\n","To set up the Streamlit frontend, install Streamlit and create a basic Streamlit application script.
